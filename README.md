These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need:  
* To have installed a package manager, for example: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://www.yarnpkg.com);  
* And a code editor, like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Sublime](https://sublimetext.com);

### Installing

Example using yarn:  

* Download or clone this project;  
* Open your favorite code editor and run `yarn install`;  
* Run `yarn run dev` and that is it!

The project is using [Metro4](https://metroui.org.ua/), if yarn didn't install it, you can get the instructions to do so [here](https://metroui.org.ua/vuejs.html).
